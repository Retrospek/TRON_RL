# TRON Reinforcement Learning

## 🎮 Overview
This project aims to develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to master the classic **TRON** game. While AI integration is currently under development, a basic interactive UI has been created for users to engage with the game environment.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive UI:** A simple user interface allows players to manually navigate and experience the TRON game.
- **Self-Play Framework:** Infrastructure set up for future AI training through self-play mechanisms.
- **Memory-Based Optimization:** Prepared for experience replay to enhance future learning efficiency.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Retrospek/TRON_RL.git
cd TRON_RL

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the interactive UI
